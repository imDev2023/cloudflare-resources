You can now safely open links in emails to view and investigate them.

From **Investigation**, go to **View details**, and look for the **Links identified** section. Next to each link, the Cloudflare dashboard will display an **Open in Browser Isolation** icon which allows your team to safely open the link in a clientless, isolated browser with no risk to the analyst or your environment. Refer to [Open links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/investigation/search-email/#open-links) to learn more about this feature.

To use this feature, you must:

- Turn on **Allow users to open a remote browser without the device client** in your Zero Trust settings.
- Have **Browser Isolation (RBI)** seats assigned.

For more details, refer to our [setup guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/remote-browser-isolation/setup/clientless-browser-isolation/).

This feature is available across these Email security packages:

- **Advantage**
- **Enterprise**
- **Enterprise + PhishGuard**
